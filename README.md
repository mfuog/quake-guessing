# Quake Guessing

Little guessing game, making use of [publicly available earthquake data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 
from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/).

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Run locally
In the project directory, run:

`yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run tests

_(disclaimer: TODO)_

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
